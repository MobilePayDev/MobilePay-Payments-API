# Error Codes

If any client errors occur, our endpoints return an error object describing the issues encountered. Each error object has the same contract. Here's an example:

```json title="Response JSON example"
{
  "code": "invalid_payment_state",
  "correlationId": "8d4243bc-aa83-43c3-a55d-5da221facd9b",
  "message": "Cannot cancel payment that is already captured.",
  "origin": "MPY"
}
```

`code` and `message` are the properties you should be interested to. `correlationId` and `origin` properties should be provided for our support team in case you need their help with any issues. The values of those properties help to find solutions quicker.
