# How to migrate

As the [**Transaction Reporting API**](https://mobilepaydev.github.io/MobilePay-TransactionReporting-API/index#overview) evolves, APIs are periodically reorganized, upgraded and improved. When APIs evolve, the old API is deprecated and eventually removed.
This page contains information you need to know when migrating from [**Transaction Reporting API**](https://mobilepaydev.github.io/MobilePay-TransactionReporting-API/index#overview) to newer and more stable [**Reporting API**](/docs/reporting/overview).


## Migration from V1 endpoints

### Payment points

[`/transaction-reporting/api/merchant/v1/paymentpoints`](https://mobilepaydev.github.io/MobilePay-TransactionReporting-API/index#payment_points_endpoint)

This endpoint was migrated to the [**Reporting API**](/docs/reporting/overview).

:::info
More information about new endpoint can be found [here](/docs/reporting/payment-points).
:::

#### Breaking changes that were made

- Paging was implemented with new `pagesize` and `pagenumber` query parameters
- Properties that were removed
- `merchantId`
- `merchantName`
- Properties that were renamed
- `paymentPoints.paymentPointId` to `paymentpoints.id`
- `paymentPoints.paymentPointName` to `paymentpoints.name`
- `paymentPoints` to `paymentpoints`

### Transfer references

[`/transaction-reporting/api/merchant/v1/paymentpoints/{paymentpointid}/transfer-references`](https://mobilepaydev.github.io/MobilePay-TransactionReporting-API/index#transfer_references_endpoint)

This endpoint was migrated to the [**Reporting API**](/docs/reporting/overview).

:::info

#### Breaking changes that were made

- `transferReferenceDate` to `transfers.date`
- Request parameters that were changed
- `paymentpointid` - in the old version of the endpoint, this property was an URL parameter, it has now been changed to the query parameter. So to get the same result as it was returned from an old endpoint, provide this query parameter.
- `from` was renamed to `startdate`
- `to` was renamed to `enddate`
- Response was changed from a JSON array to a JSON object that contains an array

### Transactions
