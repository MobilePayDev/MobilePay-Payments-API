# Introduction

MobilePay provides APIs that work together to enable you to collect and manage payments.

For information about the product and details on getting started, testing and certification please visit our [Developer Portal](https://developer.mobilepay.dk/products/)

Documentation found here will cover a new set of MobilePay APIs ([Payments API, Refunds API](/docs/payments-refunds/overview), [Payment Points API](/docs/payment-points), [Webhooks API](/docs/webhooks) which allow developers to implement app payments and will replace the current AppSwitch solution. There is [a step-by-step guide](/docs/guides/app-payments/how-it-works) which will help you with implementation.

API reference can be found [here](/api/app-payments).
