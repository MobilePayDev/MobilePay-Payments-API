# Introduction

MobilePay provides APIs that work together to enable you to collect and manage payments.

For information about the product and details on getting started, testing and certification please visit our [Developer Portal](https://developer.mobilepay.dk/products/)

Documentation found here will cover a new set of MobilePay APIs ([Payments API, Refunds API](/docs/payments-refunds/overview), [Payment Points API](/docs/payment-points), [Webhooks API](/docs/webhooks) which allow developers to implement app payments and will replace the current AppSwitch solution. There is [a step-by-step guide](/docs/guides/app-payments/how-it-works) which will help you with implementation.

This document does not include a detailed specification of the endpoints, responses, and response codes. This information can be found in the [APIs](https://developer.mobilepay.dk/product/) section of the Developer Portal. Look for **Payments** and **Webhooks**. They have the following APIs:
- PaymentPoints API

Same APIs can be found in [Sanbox APIs](https://sandbox-developer.mobilepay.dk/product) section of the Developer Portal. In it **Payments** has an extra API for testing purposes:
