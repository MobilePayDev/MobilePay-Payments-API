# OAuth access token
As a developer, you can use MobilePay APIs to manage resources on behalf of merchants. The OAuth API lets you request specific permissions from MobilePay merchants to manage their resources and get access tokens to call APIs on their behalf.

Using the access tokens you receive using OAuth you can build applications that integrate with MobilePay.
