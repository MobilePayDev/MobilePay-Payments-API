# Introduction

MobilePay provides APIs that work together to enable you to collect and manage payments.

Documentation found here will cover a specific set of MobilePay APIs ([Payments API, Refunds API](/docs/app-payments/payments-refunds/overview.md), [Payment Points API](payment-points.md), [Webhooks API](webhooks.md) which allow developers to implement MobilePay as a payment method in apps. There is [a step-by-step guide](/docs/app-payments/guides/how-it-works.mdx) which will help you with implementation.
