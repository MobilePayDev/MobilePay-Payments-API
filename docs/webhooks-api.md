# Webhooks

MobilePay uses webhooks to notify your application when an event happens in your account. They are useful for asynchronous events, e.g. when a customer confirms a payment. When an event occurs, MobilePay collects data about the event, creates an event notification and sends the event notification to the notification URL for all webhook subscriptions that are subscribed to the event.

## When to Use Webhooks

Many events that occur within a MobilePay merchant account have synchronous results immediately. E.g., a successful payment initiation will return _Payment_ object. Such requests don't require webhooks as the key information is already available.

Other events that occur are asynchronous: happening at a later time and not directly in response to your code's execution. With those APIs, MobilePay needs to notify your integration about changes to the state of an object so your integration can take subsequent steps.

The specific actions your webhook endpoint may take differs based upon the event. I.e.:

- Capturing a payment when payment state has changed (user has approved it).
- Updating records in your systems when payment point is activated and ready to be used.

## Best Practices for Using Webhooks

Review these best practices to ensure your webhooks remain secure and function seamlessly with your integration.

### Event Types

You should subscribe to the types of events required by your integration. Listening for extra events will put extra strain on your/our infrastructure and is not recommended.

You can change the events by updating your webhooks configuration.

### Return a 2xx Response

If a 2xx HTTP status code is not received within a 10s time or a status code other than 2xx is returned, MobilePay assumes that the delivery was unsuccessful. MobilePay retries the delivery of the event notification three times.

### Check the Webhook Signatures

All webhook notifications from MobilePay include a `x-mobilepay-signature` header. The value of this header is a HMAC-SHA1 signature generated by concatenating your webhook's notification URL with the body of the request (excluding all whitespaces) and hashing it using the signature key. You can validate the webhook notification by generating the HMAC-SHA1 in your code and comparing it to the signature of the event notification you received. The hash is sent in base64 format.

Example pseudocode that generates signature:

```js
var signature = new HMACSHA1(signatureKey)
  .computeHash(notificationUrl + notificationBody.removeWhitespace())
  .toBase64();
```

### Test Webhooks

Use a dedicated _Publish Test Notification_ endpoint to receive test notification. You must have configured a webhook subscription to initiate it.
